## Configuration file for XAVA. Default values are commented out. Use either ';' or '#' for commenting.


[general]

# Accepts only non-negative values.
; framerate = 60

# Keep the application in sync with the monitor to prevent tearing
# It's generally recommended to keep it on, as different framerates may lead to
# unstable frametimes and a weird looking visualizer
# -1 = adaptive Vsync (G-Sync. FreeSync, etc.)
# 0 = off
# 1 up to screen refresh rate = visualizer runs at refresh rate divided by this
# number
; vsync = 1

# The number of bars. 0 sets it to auto (put as many as you can).
# Bars' width and space between bars in number of pixels on screen.
; bars = 0

[window]

# Window width and height (in pixels)
 width = 1180

# Fullscreen toggle
; fullscreen = false

# Enables or disables window borders
; border = false

# Window transparency toggle (your system must support transparent windows)
transparency = true

# Keeps the window under any other
; keep_below = true

# This option aligns the window with a certain part of the screen
# Or if 'hold_size' is enabled, it also aligns the viewport using this rule
# The following positions are supported:
# top_left, top, top_right, left, center, right, bottom_left,
# bottom, bottom_right and none if you don't want manual positioning
alignment = 'bottom'

# Additionally we can further adjust the position if needed (in pixels)
# It moves the window (or viewport) the opposite direction of whats in alignment
# FXP. if alignment is set to right and x_padding is 20,
# it will move the window left 20 pixels and so on for every direction
; x_padding = 0
y_padding = 65

# This option removes the ability to interact with the window
; interactable = true

# Create an taskbar icon
; taskbar_icon = true

# Do or don't hold on to an viewport size specified by width and height
#
# In Layman's terms: The visualizer holds the same size as you're resizing the
# window
#
# NOTE: Works only on "supported" modes, aka cairo or OpenGL
; hold_size = false


[x11]

# Hacks and options related to X11 output modes

# Draw directly on the root window (or wallpaper) itself
# You need to stop any form of compositing for this to even work properly
; root_window = false

# Sets the override any redirection by the host WM, that is the window cannot change
# the it's order in the window stack
# This option also disables any form of interaction with the window - same as when:
#    interacable = false
; override_redirect = false

# This allows XAVA to restart when the display settings are changed
# As this can cause constant reloading (https://github.com/nikp123/xava/issues/20)
# it is left off by default (X11 only)
 reload_on_display_configure = true

# This option lets you choose a specific monitor that XAVA should occupy
# The name of the monitor is exactly the same as that of in XRandr
# Examples being: HDMI1, VGA-1
#
# If no value has been specified, XAVA treats the whole display area as a single
# monitor (if that makes sense :\)
; monitor_name = none


[wayland]

# Hacks and options related to the Wayland output modes

# Run the visualizer at "wallpaper"-level
# This makes sure that the visualizer stays behind every window.
# Enabling this automatically disables all of your inputs since
# it acts like a wallpaper, go figure. Use UNIX (kill code)
# signaling in order to reset or end XAVA.
#
# HOWEVER: This only works for compositors supporting zwlr_layer_shell
# version 1 or above. This mostly includes wlroots-based compositors.
# GNOME and KDE won't cut it here, I believe.
#
# As for when this is disabled, XAVA spawns a XDG window, but a lot of
# features are missing:
#  - keyboard and mouse input
#  - window borders (be it client-side or server-side)
#  - fullscreen mode
#  - non-transparent windows (just use background_opacity instead lol)
#  - any kind of GPU acceleration
#  - window positioning logic
#  - taskbar icon
#
# Also in XDG, XAVA may crash when resizing the window due to buffer
# related issues (If this bothers you, an issue or PR would be appreciated)
; background_layer = true

# When background_layer is enabled, this options offers you to select
# which monitor XAVA should occupy (examples: eDP-1, HDMI-A-1...)
#
# Specifying an invalid monitor would cause XAVA to fall back onto the
# last monitor available
; monitor_name = 0


[gl]

# Hacks and options related to the hardware-accelerated OpenGL modes

# Pick and choose which modules to use for drawing the visualizer.
# The order is ascending and starts from 1 and hence is drawn in that
# order. Behaves exactly like Cairo modules do.
# Refer to the README for further details.

# Specify which post-render shader the visualizer will uses
# This is used to style the visualizer in the same fashion
# as in Minecraft shaderpacks while using Optifine. Basically
# it's the same idea. Use "none" to disable, this does break
# "resolution_scale" so beware.
; post_shader = default

# Scale the resolution of the rendered visualizer by a floating-point factor
# Works similarly to "render resolution scalers" in modern AAA game engines
; resolution_scale = 1.0


[cairo]

# Options related to the *_cairo output methods
#
# Here you can specify what modules you'd like to use and in what order,
# however they must start with 1 and increment by 1. The lowest numbers
# get drawn the first, so you might be accidentally overwriting the screen
# if you put a module that draws the entire screen over some other.
#
# Refer to the README for further details.
  module_1 = bars
; module_2 = stars
; ...

#
# If you'd like, you can also adjust options (if the module supports it)
# by going into your config directory > cairo > modules > module_name >
# config.ini file
#
# There you will find a configuration similar to this one where you can
# adjust the module's parameters.
#

[input]

# Audio capturing method. Possible methods are the ones listed below.
# If one doesn't work, it might not be supported by your system or it just
# wasn't compiled with it.
#
# All input methods uses the same config variable 'source' to define where it
# should get the audio.
#
# For pulseaudio 'source' will be the source. Default: 'auto', which uses the
# monitor source of the default sink (all pulseaudio sinks(outputs) have
# 'monitor' sources(inputs) associated with them).
#
# For alsa, wasapi and portaudio 'source' will be the capture device.
#
# For fifo 'source' will be the path to fifo-file.
#
# For wasapi 'source', specify 'loopback' to capture audio from the system or
# anything else to capture from an input device, such as a microphone.
#
# For pipewire, the 'source' parameter is ignored and instead the visualizer is
# supposed to be configured using an external tool, such as 'pavucontrol' (works
# on PipeWire too, trust me).
#
# You can also specify 'list' as the source to portaudio to list all available
# audio devices

[output]

# Refer to https://github.com/nikp123/xava/tree/unstable#output-modes for
# further detail
#
# If you don't care about your windowing system, you can just use:
# opengl or cairo - the visualizer will figure out the rest.
#
# In case you still need to fiddle with your backend (possible) modes,
# they are the following:opengl, x11_opengl, x11_cairo, wayland_opengl, wayland_cairo,
#   win_opengl, win_cairo, sdl2_opengl and the "unsupported" ncurses mode

[color]

# Colors can be one of seven predefined: black, blue, cyan, green, magenta, red,
# white, yellow. Or defined by hex code '#xxxxxx' (hex code must be within '').
#
# Platform specifics:
#  - It can also be 'default' at which point under X11 it reads the color off of
#  Xrdb
#  - Under Windows 'default' uses your system accent color
#  - And on any other 'default' is just black and cyan (the default colorscheme)

# Set to 0 to disable (default).
; monstercat = 1.0

# the less difference between bars in frequency)

# Balances the eq towards higher or lower frequencies
# lower value->lower frequencies, higher value->higher frequencies
; eq_balance = 0.67

# Adjusts the FFT buffer size (calculated by 2^fft_size)
; fft_size = 14

# 'autosens' will attempt to balance the sensitivity to keep the amplitude of the bars
# within a reasonable range
; autosens = true

# 'overshoot' allows bars to overshoot (in % of display height) without initiating autosens
; overshoot = 0

# Manual sensitivity in %. Autosens must be turned off for this to take effect.
# 200.0 means double height and so on. Accepts only non-negative values.

[eq]

# This one is tricky. You can have as much keys as you want.
# Remember to uncomment more then one key! More keys = more precision.
# Look at readme.md on github for further explanations and examples.
